## The Process Framework

- Communication
- Planning
    - estimation
    - scheduling
    - risk analysis
- Modeling
    - analysis
    - design
- Construction
    - code
    - test
- Deployment
    - delivery
    - feedback

## Umbrella Activities

- Software project tracking and control
- Risk management
- Software quality assurance
- Technical reviews
- Measurement
- Software configuration management
- Reusability management
- Work product preparation an production

## The Essence of Practice

- Understand the problem
- Plan the solution
- Carry out the plan
- Examine the result

## General Principles

- The reason it all exists
- Keep it simple, stupid!
- Maintain the vision
- What you produce, other will consume
- Be open to the future
- Plan ahead for reuse
- Think!

## Personal Software Process

- Planning
- High-level design
- High-level design review
- Development
- Postmortem

## Agility Principles

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Industrial Extreme Programming 

- Readiness assessment
- Project community
- Project chartering
- Test-driven management
- Retrospectives
- Continuous learning

## Characteristics of a Software Engineer

- sense of individual responsibility
- acute awareness
- brutally honest
- resilience under pressure
- heightened sense of fairness
- attention to detail

## Principles That Guide Process

- Be agile
- Focus on quality at every step
- Be ready to adapt
- Build an effective team
- Establish mechanisms of communication and coordination
- Manage change
- Assess risk
- Create work products that provide value for others

## Principles That Guide Practice

- Divide and conquer
- Understand the use of abstraction
- Strive for consistency
- Focus on the transfer of information
- Build software that exhibits effective modularity
- Look for patterns
- When possible, represent the problem and its solution from a number of different 
- Remember that someone will mantain the software
